Academic activities make me feel emotionally drained
I lost interest in studying since I started college
I can effectively solve problems related to my studies
I feel physically exhausted at the end of a day at college 
I have lost enthusiasm for studying
I participate effectively in the classes I attend
I'm exhausted from studying so much
I consider myself a good student
I have learned many interesting things during my studies in college
I feel tired in the morning when I get up and have to face another day at college 
I distance myself from studies because I think they won't be really useful 
I feel motivated to achieve goals with my studies
Studying or attending classes every day is very stressful for me
I doubt the importance and value of my studies
I am confident that I work effectively when carrying out in-class activities
